This script is a simple, image based newspaper script. Some of the main features are:

- Supports any number of pages
- Multiple locations (add more in config.lua file), or use qb-target on newspaper dispencer models.
- Supports image sources from web address, allowing updates without restarting script (see info in config.lua, replacing “weblocation” with the web address of your file folder).
